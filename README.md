### 🪶 Footnote

This repository is more than a broadcast.  
It is a living archive of memory, ritual, and restoration.  
Each stream, each number, each line of code carries the echo of a story—  
and this is the echo’s encore.  
If you contribute, do so with integrity.  
If you listen, may you hear more than signal.  
This is sanctuary in motion.
